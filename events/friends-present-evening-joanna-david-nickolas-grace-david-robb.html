                      widely on sixteenth and seventeenth-century literature,
                      with books and articles that have frequently explored the
                      impact of contemporary religious imaginations on writing
                      and the wider and the social and political consequences of

                    <p>
                      Professor Healy's selection of Reformation poetry for the
                      evening illustrates the uneasy and the comforted self
                      found in lyric, the sense of God's English in epic and
                      ode, the provision of new spaces and voices for women in
                      verse, England as a new holy land in pastoral and georgic,
                      spiritual amorous rapture in sonnets and the testing of
                      belief in elegy.
