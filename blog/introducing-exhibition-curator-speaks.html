                    <p>
                      Almost as soon as Senate House Library decided to do a
                      major exhibition on the English Reformation, I knew that I
                      wanted to curate it. Curation has been thoroughly
                      enjoyable. It has expanded my knowledge - sometimes
                      gruesomely - with results which are not all reflected in
                      the explanatory captions on our Reformation microsite. It
                      has entailed balancing awareness of complex threads with
                      the need to present a straightforward narrative. The
                      Reformation concerned not merely clashes between
                      Catholicism and Protestantism, but also different
                      manifestations of Protestantism, which conflicted to the
                      extent that Puritans left England for the New World to
                      break free from a Protestant Anglican regime—emigration
                      reflected in John Smith’s
                      <em>Generall Historie of Virginia</em>, which viewers
                      invariably admire for its fold-out illustrations. In an
                      exhibition which focuses on the impact of the Reformation
                      we also wanted to distinguish between Reformation
                      phenomena and concurrent Renaissance developments.
                      Distinctions can blur: for example, Shakespeare is seen
                      clearly as a product of the Renaissance (as opposed to a
                      religious playwright like John Bale), but the opportunity
                      for Elizabethan secular drama arose through the Church of
                      England’s ban of mystery plays.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Thinking about the Reformation led to comparisons with
                      other countries and times. A comparison drawn from the
                      start and mentioned several times in the media, was with
                      Brexit, for England’s severance of the continental tie to
                      Rome—although the Reformation’s waves of immigration
                      between England and the continent in both directions for
                      religious reasons demonstrate clear contrasts with Brexit
                      too. Twentieth-century totalitarian states offer a sober
                      comparison for subjugating freedom of expression. There is
                      not much difference between an ordinary citizen risking
                      imprisonment or worse for criticising the leader of any
                      twentieth-century totalitarian regime, and a washerwoman
                      in Henrician England endangering herself for calling Anne
                      Boleyn a whore. Execution for treason could follow failure
                      to swear the Oath of Supremacy supporting Henry VIII in
                      1534 or to Adolf Hitler between 1934 and 1945. Wanton
                      destruction which accompanied the dissolution of English
                      monasteries, when for example royal commissioners used
                      monastic books to polish their boots and scour
                      candlesticks among other purposes, may recall the damage
                      inflicted on cultural heritage today in war-torn
                      countries.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Working on the Reformation has also infused new meaning
                      into familiar activities. The Holy Communion service
                      according to the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> includes
                      sentences about Christ coming into the world to save
                      sinners (1 Tim. 1,15) and being the propitiation for our
                      sins (1 John 2,1). Formerly these had seemed appropriate
                      for the occasion, but uncontroversial. Last Easter,
                      listening to them for the first time since writing a
                      caption for the prayer book, I was struck for the first
                      time by their triumphant aggressiveness, laying down a
                      gauntlet to the contemporary church: “forget the saints!
                      forget indulgences!” in a clarion call to the nation about
                      newly resurrected tenets.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Curation has been a journey of exploration. Part of it has
                      been an exploration of Library holdings. Various projects
                      from the last decade rendered it easy to target the
                      sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English imprints which
                      dominate the exhibition from the online catalogue. But
                      holding the books has made me marvel anew. One of my
                      favourite books in the exhibition, for the sheer fun of
                      the content, is Thomas Ward’s doggerel verse
                      <em
                        >England's Reformation (from the Time of K. Henry VIII
                        to the End of Oates's Plot)</em
                      >
                      (1747). This I found serendipitously in the stacks.
                      Reading the books makes events vivid: the chronicles with
                      their descriptions of pageantry or retailing of speech;
                      the earthy personal insults within scholarly folios
                      (Jewel).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      May those who experience the exhibition be as enriched by
                      the encounter as I have been by the preparation.
                    </p>
