                      The English Reformation prompted a renewed interest in
                      Christian apocalyptic writing, as

                      Testament book of Revelation printed in English, John
                      Bale’s
                      <a

                      (c.1545), builds upon the identification of Antichrist
                      with the Roman Catholic papacy made by the twelfth-century
                      theologian Joachim de Fiore. Bale lodges a Joachimist
                      argument concerning the opening of the seven seals and
                      blowing of the seven trumpets (Rev. 5-11), whereby each
                      seal and trumpet corresponds to a separate epoch of
                      ecclesiastical history. Bale believed that he resided
                      during the sixth age, and that the impending seventh age
                      would result in the fall of Babylon, which Bale equated
                      with the Church of Rome. Bale’s apocalyptic ideas were
                      influential in shaping the view of history adopted by his
                      protégé John Foxe, whose celebrated
                      <em>Acts and Monuments</em> (first published 1563, and
                      known from the beginning as the Book of Martyrs)
                      disseminated these ideas widely.

                      (1589), contains interesting apocalyptic commentary
                      preserved in the form of hand-written marginal glosses.
                      The handwriting matches the style of a late seventeenth-
                      or early eighteenth-century secretary script, a form of
                      cursive, and reveals a reader applying imagery from
                      Revelation to Foxe’s account of church history. Early in
                      the volume, beside Foxe’s discussion of the
                      seventh-century pope Boniface III and the Byzantine
                      Emperor Phocas, this reader has written: ‘Phocas began
                      y<sup>e</sup> 1<sup>st</sup> Beast, wth power over all
                      Kin: Rev. 13. this will continue in y<sup>e</sup> 2<sup
                        >d</sup
                      >
                      Beast, w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> two Horns of power,
                      1260 Yeares’ (Part 1, p. 75). In Revelation, the first
                      beast emerges from the Sea and terrorizes elect Christians
                      for forty-two months; he is followed by a second beast,
                      who comes of the Earth. The annotator cultivates
                      apocalyptic speculation by identifying this time span with
                      Old Testament prophecy concerning the ‘time, times, and a
                      half’ (Dan. 7:25) and replacing ‘day’ (Rev. 11:3) with
                      ‘year’, such that forty-two months equals 3.5 years, and
                      1,260 days equals 1,260 years. His view also follows that
                      of Bale, who had identified the early seventh-century
                      papacy of Boniface as the advent of apostasy within the
                      Roman church. In accounting for Byzantine-papal rivalry
                      that spanned the sixth through eighth centuries, the
                      annotator supplies further information on these ‘Horns of
                      power’ by equating the Exarchate of Ravenna, a center of
                      Byzantine power in Italy, with the horns which adorn these
                      beasts: ‘By obtaining y<sup>e</sup> Exarchate y<sup
                        >e</sup
                      >
                      pope became y<sup>e</sup> 2<sup>d</sup> Beast, having
                      y<sup>e</sup> 2. Swords - y<sup>e</sup> 1<sup>st</sup>
                      Beast was during y<sup>e</sup> Exarchate, w<sup>ch</sup>
                      was one of y<sup>e</sup> 10 crowned Horns of y<sup>e</sup>
                      1<sup>st</sup> Beast, w<sup>ch</sup> was Rome divested of
                      Power.’ (SHL, <em>Abridgement</em>, Part 1, p. 89).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This reader understands unwarranted papal assumption of
                      secular power as an iconography of two swords, symbolizing
                      (respectively) authority over church and state: concerns
                      which are shared by other writers of the time, including
                      the English bible translator William Tyndale and his
                      <em>Practyse of Prelates</em>. The annotator corrects
                      Bright’s citation of Foxe’s use of Joachim, who had taken
                      the 1,260 years as describing the period between the birth
                      of Christ and the year 1260 AD. As this reader observes,
                      however, ‘[t]he 666. years in y<sup>e</sup> Apocalypse
                      [Rev. 13:18] is y<sup>e</sup> Date of y<sup>e</sup>
                      Commencement of y<sup>e</sup> 1<sup>st</sup> Beast, or
                      y<sup>e</sup> Roman Empire, prior to y<sup>e</sup> 2<sup
                        >d</sup
                      >
                      Beast or y<sup>e</sup> Pope with temporal power AD. 606.
                      to continue 1260 yeares, or to A.D.1866----’ (SHL,
                      <em>Abridgement</em>, Part 1, p. 263). In this
                      formulation, the 666 years begin <em>circa</em> the reign
                      of Julius Caesar, and the papacy of Boniface dates the
                      beginning of Antichrist’s power that will endure until the
                      nineteenth-century. A second gloss in this location
                      corrects this misapplication of Joachim even more
                      directly: ‘a mistake of y<sup>e</sup> 1260 years in y<sup
                        >e</sup
                      >
                      Apocalyps.’ (SHL, <em>Abridgement</em>, Part 1, p. 263 and
                      repeated on p. 264). Beside a passage concerning the
                      conclusion of the Avignon papacy, during the
                      fourteenth-century, this reader identifies the Babylonian
                      exile of the Hebrews and the destruction of the Temple
                      during the First Jewish-Roman War (66-73 AD) with the
                      resumption of papal power in Italy and the looked-for
                      nineteenth-century conclusion of Antichrist’s power:
                      ‘N[ote]. The Distance between y<sup>e</sup> Babylonian
                      Captivity &amp; Temple’s fall will equal that between
                      y<sup>s</sup> [i.e. this] period, &amp; Rome’s fall.’
                      (SHL, <em>Abridgement</em>, Part 1, p. 266).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The anonymous reader of this Foxe abridgement adopts and
                      adapts an apocalyptic view of history that had been laid
                      down and revised by Foxe, Bale, Joachim, and others.
                      Foxe’s importance is unquestioned today, but Bale’s has
                      been reduced by later commentators, such as Thomas Fuller,
                      whose <em>History of the Worthies of England</em> (1662)
                      calls him ‘bilious’. Joachim is unknown outside of
                      specialist circles. Despite this neglect, books such as
                      the Senate House copy of this Foxe abridgement provide
                      important evidence for how their writings shaped later
                      thought.
