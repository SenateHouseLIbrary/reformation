                      ‘Look to your consciences and remember that the theatre of
                      the world is wider than the realm of England’, words
                      spoken by Mary, Queen of Sots at her trial at Fotheringay
                      Castle in 1586, was an admonition chosen to represent the
                      case ‘New World Order’ within Senate House Library’s
                      exhibition on the English Reformation. The end of the
                      exhibition provides the opportunity to think a little more
                      about the Reformation beyond England. A major resulting
                      fall-out on the Continent was the Thirty Years War
                      (1618-1648) as a Catholic-Protestant struggle which
                      radically changed the balance of power in Europe. As 2018
                      marks the four-hundredth anniversary of the beginning of
                      this war, we shall be commemorating it as a Feature of the
                      Month next year. It would be possible to select books
                      marking various stages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      From a denominational point of view, the exhibition
                      focussed on the Church of England as the new official
                      English church, with a nod to Puritanism through books by
                      John Bunyan, Richard Baxter (microsite only) and
                      immigration to America. We sidelined even Calvinism in the
                      interest of a strong focus: regretfully in a way, because
                      we have several early imprints by Calvin. In Germany, one
                      result of the Thirty Years War and the devastation it
                      wreaked was a desire for spiritual renewal. Fuelled partly
                      by the works of Bunyan and Baxter and partly by
                      dissatisfaction with the emphasis perceived in the
                      Lutheran church of doctrine and theology over personal
                      living among other influences, Pietism arose, with an
                      emphasis on personal faith. Ultimately its roots can be
                      traced back to the Reformation. It reached its peak in the
                      mid-eighteenth century and survives today, most obviously
                      in Germany and in outposts of the Moravian church, but
                      also implicitly in Evangelical Protestantism worldwide.
                      Had we had space to explore that route, we might have
                      represented major collections at Senate House Library that
                      were not featured. The library of Beilby Porteus
                      (1731-1809), Bishop of London from 1787 until 1809, is
                      that of a man intensely interested in the currents around
                      him. It includes among its multiple pamphlets one from
                      1749 by the Pietist leader and Moravian church leader
                      Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf,
                      <em>Hymns Composed for the Use of the Brethren</em>,
                      ‘published for the benefit of all mankind’. The work of
                      Zinzendorf’s god-father Philipp Jakob Spener (1635-1705),
                      who started the Pietist movement, is to be found in the
                      Priebsch-Closs collection of Germanic rare books, together
                      with the output of some of the major Pietist hymn writers
                      whose songs have percolated into English. Especially
                      prolific among these is Paul Gerhardt, the writer of ‘O
                      Sacred Head Sore Wounded’, and his work is also to be
                      found in the music library. For its infiltration into
                      culture, I should probably have shown Bach’s
                      <em>St Matthew Passion</em>, which weaves Gerhardt’s
                      chorale into it as a leitmotif.

                    <p>
                      The Reformation as seen in the zenith of the Pietistic
                      movement merges with the early history of the University
                      of London through its first bulk donation of antiquarian
                      books, noted in 1838. The books were given by a medical
                      practitioner of Ilfracombe, one Nathaniel Vye. They
                      feature eighteenth-century German devotional literature of
                      a Pietistic bent and may well have been first owned by
                      somebody in the Moravian heartlands: we can surmise this
                      from the bright blue or pink paste endpapers, which were
                      popular in the area at the time. Shown here is the fourth
                      edition of daily prayers by Johann Friedrich Starck
                      (1680-1756),
                      <em
                        >Johann Friedrich Starcks Morgen- und Abend-Andachten
                        frommer Christen auf alle Tage im Jahre</em
                      >
                      (Frankfurt am Main, 1766). The sub-title indicates the
                      natures of the work: wie solche aus der Quelle des
                      göttlichen Worts fliessen, darinn das lebendige
                      Christenthum, wie ein wahrer Christ inwendig und
                      auswendig, vor Gott und den Menschen beschaffen seyn soll,
                      beschrieben wird (‘how such [prayers] flow from the source
                      of the divine Word, describing living Christianity, what a
                      true Christian should be like internally and externally
                      before man and before God’). Starck was a prolific
                      theological writer who was very popular in his time, and
                      who wrote for all occasions, most distinctively a booklet
                      of daily prayers for women who were pregnant or giving
                      birth (<em
                        >Tägliches Gebetbüchlein für Schwangere und
                        Gebährende</em
                      >). He also wrote about one thousand hymns, none of which
                      survived to twentieth-century hymn books. By contrast, the
                      prayers in his morning and evening prayers were printed as
                      recently 1963. Simple, direct and personal, they are not
                      timebound. The Senate House Library copy is the only copy
                      of the fourth edition noted in the United Kingdom and one
                      of only two copies of any edition.

                    <p>
                      I should like to end this blog post with a sharp turn.
                      Reading background material for an exhibition, as for any
                      other purpose, one quickly comes to respect the masters in
                      the field. A major figure is Arthur Geoffrey Dickens
                      (1910-2001), whose <em>The English Reformation</em> (1964)
                      established him as the leading historian of his generation
                      in the field. Dickens’s obituary in the
                      <em>Independent</em> (9 August 2001) wrote that it was a
                      landmark in Tudor historiography; that in the
                      <em>Telegraph</em> (2 August 2001) that it established a
                      new benchmark of excellence for such surveys and set the
                      agenda for teaching and research in the field for the next
                      25 years. Criticism came not of its content, but of its
                      ending with the death of Mary Tudor in 1558, and of an
                      interpretation which it was felt neglected the vigour of
                      Catholicism and unpopularity of Protestantism in Tudor
                      England. Dickens was the Director of the Institute of
                      Historical Research at Senate House from 1967 until his
                      retirement in 1977. Consequently, the University Archive
                      holds his papers (<a

                      to The English Reformation, mainly to its second edition
