                      The story of English Reformation history is rarely told
                      without reference to John Foxe’s
                      <em>Acts and Monuments</em> (more often called Foxe’s Book
                      of Martyrs). Although researchers have made great strides
                      in distancing themselves from Foxe’s biases and
                      presentation of Tudor history the execution of Protestants
                      under Queen Mary continues to evoke popular attention.
                      Comparison, for example, of the description that Foxe gave
                      for the execution of Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley to
                      the opening scenes of the 1998 film, Elizabeth, aptly
                      demonstrates a connection to Foxe’s story.

                    <p>
                      Although Michael Hirst (writer) and Skekhar Kapur
                      (director) refrain from inserting into Latimer’s mouth,
                      Foxe’s famous refrain to ‘play the man’, the scene invokes
                      the slow burn of the fire that elitists a call ‘I burn too
                      slowly’, or in Foxe’s terms ‘I cannot burne’ (1583, p.
                      1794). That the burning of Latimer and Ridley should
                      become an archetype of sorts for Marian martyrdom is no
                      surprise. They were amongst the best-known of the
                      Edwardian Protestants who chose to remain in England when
                      Queen Mary came to the throne.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There is, however, more to the story than this. When
                      Latimer tells Ridley to ‘play the man’, Foxe expects his
                      well-educated readers to recognise the reference. He
                      expects a comparison to be made between the archetypes of
                      Marian martyrdom and an archetype of ancient Roman
                      martyrdom. To the modern reader, this is, perhaps, little
                      more than an interesting oddity. To the readers of Foxe,
                      however, it is an indication that the evocative tales of
                      burning Protestants had more meaning than a contemporary
                      memorial. They were a link in a chain. A number in a
                      sequence. They were both individual witnesses to the true
                      faith and a member of a community that displayed the same
                      characteristics and enacted similar troupes across time
                      and space.

                      Turn the pages of the 1583 edition of
                      <em>Acts and Monuments</em> from the tales of Marian
                      burnings. Pass through those sections focused on Henrician
                      martyrs such as Anne Askew and Henry’s passing of the
                      anti-Protestant Act of Six Articles. Pass further back to
                      stories revealing the Pope as Antichrist and King John,
                      not as a tyrant but as a proto-protestant defender of the
                      true church. Pass beyond the stories of Norman Conquest
                      and Anglo-Saxon kingship. Turn back to the near-beginning
                      of Foxe’s massive volume and you will find there a series
                      of stories that summarise the first 300 years of
                      Christianity and envisage it as an era of ten major
                      persecutions. Nestled within that account is the story of
                      Polycarp and the words ‘be of good cheer Polycarp and play
                      the man’.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Foxe has not created these words for Polycarp out of
                      no-where. It is a direct translation from the
                      fourth-century ecclesiastical history written by Eusebius
                      of Caesarea (263-339). Latimer’s words, then, are a copy
                      and a play on Polycarp connecting the sixteenth-century
                      martyr to a second-century martyr through a fourth-century
                      source. The comparison was an obvious one. Both Latimer
                      and Polycarp were bishops and then martyrs. They were both
                      old men. Eusebius tells us that Polycarp was over 80 years
                      old. Latimer was well into his 70s. Their method of
                      defence also contained parallels; both men argued that
                      they had lived a long life and never once crossed the line
                      into sedition and treason. In both cases, the
                      establishment disagreed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Does this indicate that Latimer never said those words on
                      the pyre or does it suggest that Latimer, himself, copied
                      Polycarp? Is this a literary invention or well-planned
                      rhetoric by a man who knew he was going to die in front of
                      a crowd? Scholars generally agree that Foxe went to
                      strenuous efforts to get to the truth of eye-witness
                      accounts of the Marian burnings. The stories were framed
                      as hagiography. They depicted recurring themes of
                      martyrdom. Yet, they were based on written and oral
                      testimony. The style was literary. The content based on
                      evidence. Foxe did not want his memorials revealed as
                      fraudulent.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Nonetheless, there is a reason to believe it a literary
                      invention. Foxe gets his material for Latimer and Ridley
                      from two eye-witnesses. The first, George Shipside was a
                      former servant of Ridley. He claimed that Latimer had said
                      ‘Be of good heart brother, for God will assure the fury of
                      the flame, or else straight us to abide it’. Shipside
                      more-or-less claimed Polycarp’s words for Latimer. The
                      second witness, Augustine Bernher, had been Latimer’s
                      assistant. He claimed different words had been said, but
                      he did also provide Foxe with testimony for another
                      martyr, Robert Glover. We are told that Glover fell to
                      despair once his execution had been set. Bernher claims to
                      have comforted him:

                    <p class="rteright"><em>(A&amp;M, 1583, 1737).</em></p>

                    <p>
                      Whilst we cannot say for certain that Latimer never spoke
                      the words of Polycarp, the evidence from Shipside and
                      Bernher would suggest literary invention, sparked, perhaps
                      by something that Latimer did say or, at least, something
                      that they thought he should have said. In the end, it is
                      unimportant. What these words did was connect the
                      classical martyr Polycarp to Latimer and, by association,
                      to Glover. Examples such as this, demonstrate that Foxe’s
                      <em>Book of Martyrs</em> must be treated cautiously. It is
                      one part historical record, but another part a literary
                      creation and a religious statement. Foxe’s book tells us
                      more about the creation and curation of popular cultural
                      knowledge by the Elizabethan printing press than it does
                      about actual history.
