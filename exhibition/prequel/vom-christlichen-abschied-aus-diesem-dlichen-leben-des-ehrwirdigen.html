        Martin Luther was a <em>persona non grata</em> with Henry VIII, who
        never forgave him for the obloquy Luther heaped on him in response to
        Henry’s <em>Assertio septem sacramentorum</em>. Henry wrote an open
        letter to Luther, printed in two editions (Latin and English) by Richard
        Pynson in Fleet Street in 1527. Although Lutheranism never gained a
        substantial following in England, it was the earliest form of
        Protestantism to make an impact there, with Luther’s insistence upon the
        biblical principle of justification by faith shattering Catholic
        Christianity in Britain as elsewhere. Shown here is a detailed account
        of Luther’s death and funeral by another German reformer, Justus Jonas
        (1493-1555). Jonas, a friend, colleague and translator of Luther,
        accompanied Luther on his final journey, from Halle to Eisleben, so was
        among the circle of supporters, doctors and minor nobility who watched
        Luther’s death: the death was significant because a ‘good death’ was
        seen as a sign of salvation, whereas a bad one might imply that the soul
        was hell-bound. Jonas’s description was rushed into print. A flood of
        commemorative images followed Luther’s demise. The one here, by Lucas
        Cranach the Elder, made Luther’s image iconic and instantly
        recognisable.
