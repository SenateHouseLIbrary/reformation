        William Forrest (fl. 1530-1576) was chaplain to Mary Tudor and a
        prolific Catholic poet. He wrote the long metrical poem
        <em>The History of Grisild the Second</em> in 1558 and presented it in
        manuscript to Mary in thanks to her. To Forrest, the Reformation
        resulted from tyranny arising from Henry VIII’s infatuation with Anne
        Boleyn. His account of Katherine of Aragon’s divorce from Henry VIII is
        unambiguously sympathetic to Katherine, casting her as Grisild (from
        Chaucer’s ‘Clerk’s Tale’) on account of her great patience, and Henry as
        Walter, for behaving with ‘much wickedness’. Other participants retain
        their own names: ‘Thomas Wulsaye’; ‘Anne Bullayne’. This is the first
        printed form of the poem. Its editor is under no illusions about it:
        ‘Little as it can claim of regard for poetical merit, there is yet a
        quaintness and simplicity in the greater part of it that always redeem
        it from contempt, and often render it amusing. But it is in the
        illustrations of contemporary history which it affords that its chief
        value lies’. Forrest was an eye-witness to some scenes and includes some
        historical details not found elsewhere, such as attitudes to the divorce
        in Oxford.
