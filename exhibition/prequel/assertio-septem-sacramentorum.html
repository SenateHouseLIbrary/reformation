        In the early 1520s, nothing could have been further from Henry VIII’s
        mind than seceding from the Roman Catholic Church. Thomas More and
        Bishop John Fisher helped him to refute Martin Luther’s
        <em>The Babylonian Captivity of the Church </em>(1520) and defend the
        seven sacraments of the Church (reduced by Luther to two, baptism and
        the eucharist) in the <em>Assertio septem sacramentorum</em>. Henry
        further asserts the authority of the Pope as ‘the Chief Priest and
        Supreme Judge upon Earth’. First published in 1521, the work ran through
        five editions in Latin and German in 1522-3; it is shown here in its
        first English translation. In it Henry vituperates Luther for malice,
        evil, impudence, and describes him as a serpent and a hideous monster,
        full of venom. Luther answered by abusing Henry as a pig and a drunkard.
        Henry dedicated the <em>Assertio</em> to Pope Leo X, who rewarded him by
        bestowing upon him the title ‘Fidei defensor’, ‘Defender of the Faith’:
        a title formally conferred by Cardinal Wolsey at a grand ceremony at
        Greenwich Palace in 1522. Although Henry later disowned the book, the
        title remained, and the initials ‘F.D.’ remain beside the head of the
        monarch on English coins today.
