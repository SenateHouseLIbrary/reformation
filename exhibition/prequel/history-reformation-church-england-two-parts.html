        Gilbert Burnet’s voluminous History of the Reformation of the Church of
        England constitutes the first attempt to write an account of the English
        Reformation from authentic sources. Burnet began his research in 1677 in
        answer to a new French translation of Nicholas Sanders’s
        <em>De origine et progressu schismatia Anglicani libri tres</em>
        (1585), which saw the English Reformation as illegitimate, being a
        political act executed by a corrupt king. Burnet conceded Henry VIII’s
        faults, but argued that flawed&nbsp;princes could still be instruments
        of divine providence. Lack both of time and of attention to detail led
        to numerous mistakes. But Burnet’s defence of the Reformation met with
        tremendous acclaim (all the more so because the Popish Plot came to
        light while Burnet was writing), with thanks from both Houses of
        Parliament, the conferral of the degree of Doctor of Divinity from
        Oxford, and several editions of the text and abridgements. Burnet’s
        dedication to Charles II outlines the Reformation as&nbsp;an ongoing
        process: begun under Henry VIII, advanced under Edward VI, sealed with
        the blood of Marian martyrs; brought to a full settlement under
        Elizabeth I; defended by James I; overthrown under Charles I; and
        restored by Charles II’s restoration to the throne.
