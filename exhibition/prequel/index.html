              <h2>A world shattered</h2>

              <p>
                Martin Luther was a monk and professor of moral theology at the
                University of Halle-Wittenberg. On 31 October 1517, he sent 95
                theses disputing the power of indulgences to the archbishop of
                Mainz and, in line with university custom, probably posted them
                on the door of All Saints Church, Wittenberg. In doing so he
                sparked a movement that was to shatter the unity of the Catholic
                Church in Europe. His criticisms of ecclesiastical corruption,
                in particular the sale of ‘indulgences’—certificates giving the
                purchaser a reduction in their period of suffering in purgatory
                after death—were reproduced in pamphlet form and disseminated
                widely, thanks to the revolutionary mechanisation of print
                technology. A network of theologians such as Jean Calvin and
                Ulrich Zwingli could now not only communicate or argue with each
                other more easily, but for the first time share their thoughts
                quickly with a wider public. The result was the Protestant
                Reformation.
              </p>

              <p>
                At first, England was largely sheltered from the ensuing turmoil
                of doctrinal reformation and counter-reformation that swept
                across the continent; indeed, Henry VIII had authored Assertio
                septem sacramentorum (In Defence of the Seven Sacraments) in
                1521, rejecting Luther’s ideas and earning him the title
                ‘Defender of the Faith’ from the Pope. In England, the impetus
                for Reformation was very different: it came from Henry VIII’s
                desire to wed Anne Boleyn and father a son to succeed him, even
                though he was already married to Catherine of Aragon. The Pope’s
                reluctance to grant an annulment led to a radical solution:
                Henry overthrew the authority of Rome and established himself as
                the Head of the Church of England with the Act of Supremacy in
                1534.
              </p>

              <p>
                The consequences of taking England outside the family of
                Catholic states were profound. In particular, it had a major
                impact on London throughout the sixteenth and early seventeenth
                centuries, as it grew into one of the world’s largest cities.
                Focusing on London during this period, Reformation: Shattered
                World, New Beginnings traces the impact of the Reformation on
                culture and society; the way its communications industry drove
                change; and the consequences of the emergence of a new world
                order.
              </p>

              <h2>The Impact on London</h2>

              <p>
                London’s position as a principal centre of commerce in northern
                Protestant Europe, as well its place at the heart of the English
                print industry, meant that new religious ideas spread rapidly.
                London became a magnet for migrants and refugees from the
                continent, swelling the existing foreign-born mercantile
                communities. In particular, Huguenots fleeing persecution in
                France arrived in large numbers, as well as settlers from the
                Low Countries escaping the Catholic counter-reformation. In
                consequence the city’s population rose from around 50,000 in
                1530 to over 200,000 by 1600. Yet there was a real concern that
                England’s decision to break away from Rome would result in an
                economic, or even military, backlash from the Continent, and
                that important trading links would cease.
              </p>

              <p>
                Henry VIII’s wholesale dismantling of England’s monasteries in
                the 1530s meant that many key London landmarks and buildings
                changed hands, since nearly half of all property had been owned
                by monastic institutions. Consequently the city developed a
                different cultural feel, with outbreaks of iconoclasm and
                destruction of religious images—organised vandalism—that many
                found distressing to witness. The knock-on effect of the
                dissolution of the monasteries was to shift their former role as
                providers of welfare (healthcare and shelter for vulnerable
                elements of society) into secular hands that were not always
                ready to take them on. As the century progressed, this
                contributed to a growing sense of insecurity as poor harvests
                also increased the number of ’sturdy beggars‘. The resulting
                reaction against vagrants heralded the Elizabethan Poor Laws.
                London, given its rapid population growth, was particularly
                affected.
              </p>

              <p>
                During this period, London was gripped by a particular intensity
                of change that was unique in England, created by the exceptional
                concentration of people living in one square mile. Tension rose
                on the streets as radical preachers from both sides of the
                religious divide used sermons to express their views, alongside
                ideological warfare by pamphlet—the equivalent to the explosion
                of social media and proliferation of ‘alternative facts’ today.
                A deep-rooted suspicion of popery pervaded society, with bans on
                foreign travel to Italy enforced. Punitive measures were imposed
                to ensure religious compliance: failing to swear the oath of
                supremacy, for example, carried terrible penalties, and people
                were shocked to hear stories of the arrest of bishops and the
                execution of clergy as the law was enforced.
              </p>

              <p>
                In a time before universal literacy, and when even the capacity
                to travel beyond the village of one’s birth was beyond many,
                religion provided a lens through which people understood the
                world around them, and a comfort that explained the hardships of
                daily life. Rapid changes in local religious practice, of which
                the destruction of the monasteries was a major part, profoundly
                affected people at an everyday level, a manifestation of the
                confusing theological arguments swirling around that
                fundamentally challenged long-held beliefs about eternal
                damnation and the fate of one’s soul. While some embraced the
                new faith and others persisted with their traditional beliefs,
                some were unable to cope with having their familiar world
                shattered and suffered trauma that sometimes led to insanity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Yet out of the darkness, as the stone edifices of familiar
                religious buildings were pulled down, came new forms of cultural
                expression. London witnessed its own renaissance in the fields
                of art, music, and literature. Language experienced a profound
                transformation with the rise of influential vernacular texts,
                including devotional works and personal Bibles. Over time,
                theatres and play-houses proliferated, resulting in an
                outpouring of new literary works by playwrights such as William
                Shakespeare, some of which are still with us today.
