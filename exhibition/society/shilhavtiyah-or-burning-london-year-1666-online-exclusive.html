    <p>The Great Fire of London raged between 2 and 5 September 1666 and demolished about four-fifths of London: over 13,000 private dwellings and almost all civic buildings. Whilst strong wind and plenty of dry timber fuelled the fire, residents soon blamed scapegoats. Catholic-Protestant division was clear. Pamphlets sported such titles as: <em>London's flames: … concerning the dreadful fire of London in the year 1666 … Together with what was said by Mr. Langhorn, … condemned for the horrid Popish Plot, concerning the Great Fire. wherein is plainly proved, that the Papists were the contrivers and actors in the burning of that great and noble city</em> (1679); <em>London's flames reviv'd … By all which it appears, that the said fires were contrived, and carried on by the Papists</em> (1689). Not until 1831 was an inscription on the Fire’s commemorative monument, blaming it on ‘treachery and malice of the Popish Faction’, removed. In the preface of <em>Shilhavtiyah </em>Samuel Rolle, whilst not directly accusing Catholics, suspects them of guilt, saying that most treatises about the Fire which he has seen say so, and claiming that they invite suspicion by their joy following the Fire.</p>
