    <p>‘Geographically its spread has been global for hundreds of years: wherever in the world there are English readers, there are copies. In the story of the earth we live on, its influence cannot be calculated. Its words have been found to have a unique quality …’ (David Daniell). The King James Version of the Bible is the bestselling book in the world, and its longevity (over four hundred years) is an unparalleled phenomenon. It has mediated to us numerous phrases from earlier versions of the Bible, such as ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’ and ‘a law unto themselves’. The King James Bible is a result of the English Reformation, in that it is a revolt against a strongly Protestant text: James I of England was averse to the notes of the Geneva Bible (shown) as being ‘very partial, untrue, seditious, and savouring too much of dangerous and traitorous concerts’. The King James Bible, by contrast, eschewed doctrinal notes. It was a conservative volume using archaic language and was intended to reset the standard of a solid middle-of-the-road Anglican establishment. The King James Bible was to be used for services in all churches in England.</p>
