    <p>This book is an English verse adaptation of Sebastian Brant’s tremendously popular <em>Narrenschiff</em> (‘Ship of Fools’, 1494). The book is about the shipping of all kinds of fools, introduced by category, to the Land of Fools. The poet and clergyman Alexander Barclay’s version, first published in 1509, contains copious additions to present a picture of contemporary English social life. It reminds us that the criticism of the Church which marked the Reformation, far from originating then, continued an earlier strain. Alongside riotous servants and corrupt lawyers among others, Barclay attacks parish clergy for ignorance and worldliness, and monks and friars whose primary interest is gluttony, with such lines as: ‘Such fooles have their minds on riches / On cursed lucre, pleasure, ioy and wealth / Caring nought at all for their soules health’. The printer, John Cawood, who operated in St Paul’s Churchyard, is an example of a survivor of two regimes. He made his fortune as Queen’s Printer for Mary Tudor, under whom he printed such key Catholic texts as Bishop Bonner’s <em>Homilies</em> and Archbishop Cranmer’s official retraction. His connection with her regime was, however, loose enough for him to continue in his role under Elizabeth I.</p>
